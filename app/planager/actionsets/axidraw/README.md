# Planager Axidraw Action

## To install the Axidraw API

Up-to-date instructions on installing and using the Axidraw API can be found on
[the Axidraw documentation site](https://axidraw.com/doc/py_api/). I included
the basic usage here, but you should consult the documentation for any
questions. If you have Python 3.6 or greater installed, run the following
command in the terminal to install the Axidraw CLI and Python API:
`python -m pip install https://cdn.evilmadscientist.com/dl/ad/public/AxiDraw_API.zip`

## Running via the CLI

To plot an SVG via the commandline, run the command `axicli FILENAME.svg`.
